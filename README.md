# Detecting Conflicts between Data-Minimization and Security Requirements in Business Process Models
Qusai Ramadan, Daniel Strüber, Mattia Salnitri, Volker Riediger, Jan Jürjens

In this file, we present the artifact used in our paper. Our submission includes
a prototypical implementation of our work on top of STS, the supporting
tool for the BPMN extension [SecBPMN2](http://www.secbpmn.disi.unitn.it/), whose security requirements
we reused. Our implementation supports the two main contributions of this work: First,
the modeling of data-minimization and security requirements in BPMN models, using
a suitable model editor. Second, automated conflict analysis in data-minimization- and
security-annotated BPMN models, based on our catalog of anti-patterns.

## Performing automatic conflicts detection. 
To view and modify our designed modelsplease follow the instructions:
* Install the STS tools from [here](http://www.sts-tool.eu/downloads/secbpmn-dm/) .
* Download the *project.exp* file from (https://figshare.com/s/dc927ca696ef6bd753c7) to your desktop. This file is automatically generated from the STS tool and it contains all the SecBPMN2 models of our case study. 
* To view and modify the models in this file you need to import it into the STS:
   * In the STS tool, do *File→ Import → project → next → select the "project.exp" file from your desktop. 
 
 * The projects contains two SecBPMN2 models namely, 

* In case you want to insert a new designed SecBPMN2 model or a modefied version of the provied SecBPMN2 models into our transformations approach, please:
   * First, from the workspace of the STS tool please finde the SecBPMN2 model file that you want to transform. 
   * Second, simply copy and paste the file into the *my.example* directory. 
   * Third, since our approach take an inpt a (.bpmn) files, please right click on the inserted file  → rename → change the file   extension to bpmn.
