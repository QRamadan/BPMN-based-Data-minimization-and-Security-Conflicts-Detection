# Detecting Conflicts between Data-Minimization and Security Requirements in Business Process Models
Qusai Ramadan, Daniel Strüber, Mattia Salnitri, Volker Riediger, Jan Jürjens

In this file, we present the artifact used in our paper. Our submission includes
a prototypical implementation of our work on top of STS, the supporting
tool for the BPMN extension [SecBPMN2](http://www.secbpmn.disi.unitn.it/), whose security requirements
we reused. Our implementation supports the two main contributions of this work: First,
the modeling of data-minimization and security requirements in BPMN models, using
a suitable model editor. Second, automated conflict analysis in data-minimization- and
security-annotated BPMN models, based on our catalog of anti-patterns.
